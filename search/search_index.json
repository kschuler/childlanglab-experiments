            "text": "Guidelines \n Documentation\n\n\nThese are the general guidelines we follow for documenting and managing our research.\n\n\nProject management with Twist\n\n\nWe manage all of our research projects via \nTwist\n.  Twist is a web-based project management application that allows teams to work together toward accomplishing projects.  If you are new to twist, you can read the onboarding documentation here:\n\n\n\n\nWhat is twist?\n\n\nGetting started for new users\n  \n\n\n\n\nHow we use Twist\n\n\nGeneral and Support channels\n\n\nWe have two main channels in Twist: \nGeneral\n and \nSupport\n.  Our \nGeneral\n channel is meant for lab-wide communication and announcements.  Things like welcoming new lab members, lab meeting updates, and other lab news.  Our \nSupport\n channel is meant to be used when lab members have questions or to talk about general recruiting projects and events, etc.\n\n\nAs a lab notebook\n\n\nWe also use Twist as a lab notebook.  Each series of studies has a channel, and each experiment within that series has it's own thread in the channel.  All communications about an experiment should be made on this single thread, so we know exactly where to look for decisions that have been made about a particular study.\n\n\nResearch folder\n\n\nWhy this folder is so important\n\n\nThe \nResearch\n folder contains all of the \nofficial\n files associated with the lab's experiments.  These files are \npermanent\n (we keep them \nforever\n).  Years from now, if someone wanted to see the materials or raw data from a particular study, we would need to send these files to them.  Because they are so important, there are very strict guidelines on what you can store in this folder and how.\n\n\nFile organization system\n\n\nThe \nResearch\n folder is organized by study series:\n\n\n\n\nWithin each study series, files are organized by \ntype\n (NOT by sub-experiment).  Over the years, I have found this to be a more intuitive way for me to find things.  Looking for an experiment design sheet? It's in the design-sheet's folder.  Looking for the raw data for an experiment? It will be in the raw-data folder.  This also drastically simplifies the folder structure.  There is a single document or single sub-folder for each experiment within each of the folders shown below.  There are no other files in any other place.\n\n\n\n\nThis is \nvery important\n because all of our data analysis scripts are based on this organization. Failing to store files according to this system will \nbreak all of our data analysis scripts\n.\n\n\nNaming conventions\n\n\nWithin each of these folders, there is a single file or sub-folder for each individual experiment.  All files and folders begin with the experiment id, the collection that the experiment belongs to, followed by a descriptive title in all lower-case with \n-\n as the separator:\n\n\n\n\nEXPID-collection-descriptive-title\n\n\n\n\nThis ensure that (1) when sorted alphabetically, the files will arrange by ID number, (2) that whenever a file is opened or shared, the filename makes it absolutely clear what it is you are looking at (e.g. there are not a million files named \"data\"), and (3) searching by EXPID allows you to find all files related to a given experiment.\n\n\nCollections of experiments can be identified by the first name in the experiment title, and sub-collections can be identified by the experiment id number (\nEXPID\n).  \n\n\nWhat to save in each folder\n\n\nEach folder has its own unique constraints.  The guidelines for what can be saved in each folder are below.\n\n\nsubject-tracking\n\n\n\n\ncontains a single \n.csv\n file for each experiment and is appended with \n-track.csv\n (e.g. \n0160-empiricalyang-9noun-hfrule-child-track.csv\n)\n\n\n\n\nstimuli\n\n\n\n\ncontains a single \nfolder\n for each experiment appended with \n-stims\n (e.g. \n0160-empiricalyang-9noun-hfrule-child-stims\n)\n\n\ninside this folder are all of the stimuli for the experiment arranged in sub-folders labeled by file type (e.g. \nconditions\n, \nsounds\n, \nimages\n, \nmovies\n, etc.)\n\n\nmay also contain a Word document called \ninstructions-text.docx\n which are the instructions provided to the participant during the experiment.\n\n\n\n\nraw-data\n\n\n\n\ncontains a single \nfolder\n for each experiment appended with \n-raw-data\n (e.g. \n0160-empiricalyang-9noun-hfrule-child-raw-data\n)\n\n\ninside this folder are all of the raw data for the experiment (one file or folder per subject)\n\n\nsubject data folders are named: \nSID-YEAR-MONTH-DAT-HHMMSS\n (e.g. \nC01-2016-06-17-100307\n)\n\n\nsubject data files are named \nSID-YEAR-MONTH-DAY-HHMMSS-datatype.csv\n (e.g. \nC01-2016-06-17-100307-exposure.csv\n)\n\n\n\n\nprocessed-data\n\n\n\n\ncontains a single \nfolder\n for each experiment appended with \n-processed-data\n (e.g. \n0160-empiricalyang-9noun-hfrule-child-processed-data\n)\n\n\ninside this folder are all of the processed data for the experiment.  This may be:\n\n\nan empty text file, indicating that no processed data exists\n\n\none or more files with data that has been manipulated in some way (e.g. preprocessed, transcribed, coded, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexperiments\n\n\n\n\ncontains a single \nfolder\n for each experiment appended with \n-exp\n (e.g. \n0160-empiricalyang-9noun-hfrule-child-exp\n)\n\n\ninside this folder are all of the experiment code and files including:\n\n\nchange-log.txt\n: a record of small changes made to the experiment code\n\n\nstimuli folders where necessary (e.g. \nimages\n, \nconditions\n)\n\n\nat least one file containing the experiment script (e.g. \nrun-exp-v1.py\n or \nrun-exp-v1.html\n)\n\n\npossibly a \nyaml\n parameter file containing the parameters for a given experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: While I manage code for full experiment paradigms on \ngithub\n, I find this to be overkill for every single experiment.  Often an experiment uses an existing paradigm with no changes to the code (or very minor changes).  All available experiment paradigms are stored on \ngithub\n and can be downloaded via our \nExperiment Library\n.\n\n\n\n\ndocs\n\n\n\n\ncontains a single \nfolder\n for each experiment appended with \n-docs\n (e.g. \n0160-empiricalyang-9noun-hfrule-child-docs\n)\n\n\ninside this folder are any auxiliary documents that we want to keep forever, but do not belong anywhere in the remaining folder architecture.  Often these are things like:\n\n\nData sheet templates for when we record things by hand.\n\n\nCall for participants/recruitment procedures\n\n\nNotes from the experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndesign-sheets\n\n\n\n\ncontains a single excel workbook for each experiment appended with \n-design.xslx\n (e.g. \n0160-empiricalyang-9noun-hfrule-child-design.xslx\n)\n\n\na \nsingle\n file is very important, so there are not several different excel files and notes containing the experiment design.  A single file with a worksheet for each aspect of the design is more than sufficient to contain the details of each experiment.\n\n\n\n\nanalyses\n\n\n\n\ncontains a single \nfolder\n for each experiment appended with \n-analysis\n (e.g. \n0160-empiricalyang-9noun-hfrule-child-analysis\n)\n\n\ninside this folder are two additional files:\n\n\nthe \nR\n markdown file and the \nhtml\n file it generates",
